          <p>
            I am a former student with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science
            and minors in Computer Networking and Applied Mathematics. My time
            at Wentworth Institute of Technology has taught me a lot about the
            core concepts of Computer Science, Computer Networking, and Applied
            Mathematics, specifically within the fields of algorithms and data
            structures. During my internships with Delsys Inc. and Wentworth
            Institute of Technology I expanded my knowledge on app development,
            machine learning, and databases. I have the most experience working
            with Java, JavaScript, and Python, though I have also worked with
            other languages and frameworks such as Electron, React, MySQL, C#,
            C++, HTML5, and CSS3.

              Project name paperTrade. Investing is not something that is
              typically taught in schools, so learning it yourself is hard. In
              addition to this, many people don’t have enough money to pay for a
              wealth manager. In order to educate people, paperTrade uses real
              market data to simulate a real investing experience without the
              risk of losing money. By experiencing the various aspects of
              buying and selling securities, users get comfortable with how the
              market works. This will be coupled with an educational and goal
              aspect that will help deepen a user’s knowledge of the market. The
              app will find a balance between simplifying the investment process
              and making users aware of the associated risks. This would
              eventually lower the barrier to entry to engage in the real stock
              market because of the user’s rise in confidence to properly
              execute investments. This was a team project that involved myself,
              Christopher Dombele, and Ryan Bebb.

              Project name BostonCrave. The motivation for this project was to
              create a web application that’s worth using. We wanted to make
              something that we could be proud of, something that could be of
              service to our peers and our own selves. The purpose of this
              project was to apply what we learned throughout the web
              development course. This mainly included HTML, CSS, and
              Javascript. Using our knowledge of these concepts, languages, and
              skills, we were tasked with creating a dynamic web application.
              The application had to be interactive, responsive, and able to
              complete a user requested task. This was a team project which
              consisted of myself, Christopher Dombele, Phakkhaphon
              Plukfangpanya, and Deni Pasholli.

              Project name Media_List is a self developed project using
              Electron. The purpose of the project was to create a desktop
              applicatoin that would function as a better Notepad. I used
              Notepad to keep track of the movies and tv shows that I was
              watching. As time went on, the list grew in length. I found myself
              using the search functionality which the application was capable
              of. However, the search functionality was undesirable. Instead of
              finding a similar application online, I decided to use my skills
              and create my own application.
